            <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

            <p>If you're reading this, hello! I have torn down this weblog, down to this
                single index page. There is no styling, no dynamic content, no scripts, no
                archives, no tags or categories. Just a fresh start, right here.</p>

            <p>I'm going to rebuild this blog as a static site. I mentioned last week that
                I have to change hosting providers and wasn't looking forward to moving
                this website. I got to thinking about how a lot of what I've maintained
                here over the years isn't really useful anymore. I really don't want to
                wrangle with Wordpress or other blogging software. Most of the custom
                programming I've done has been to support defunct things like the Demo
                Club and email lists. So there no good reason to keep maintaining a
                database and PHP install.</p>

            <p>I've looked into all the hot new static site generators and while there's a
                <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">ton of them</a>, I'm not excited by
                any of them. Plus, there's always <em>something</em> that needs custom
                hacking, and the hacking part is fun. And it's been awhile since I've
                hacked something together just for myself.</p>

            <p>So I'm going to write my own static blog generator, and blog about it here.
                It's the perfect time for this. We're sliding into winter, and I need a
                project. I'm not writing any music. I'm 20 pages deep into a comic script
                that I have no energy to start drawing yet. So yeah, let's do this!</p>

            <h2>Eating an elephant</h2>

            <p>I'm making a promise to myself right now that I'm only going to work on one
                tiny feature at a time and go easy on myself. This is how I finished <a
                    href="https://neathobby.com/special/the-last-reunion-show/">THE LAST
                    REUNION SHOW</a> &mdash; basically a panel or two every evening was
                enough to feel like I'd done something.
            </p>

            <p>I have some very basic requirements:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>File-based, so I can add a post by saving a file from a text editor.
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax">Markdown</a>
                    support, so I don't have to write out HTML for unordered lists like
                    this one, grrr.</li>
                <li>A common metadata format, probably based on <a
                        href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">front
                        matter</a>. </li>
                <li>Next and previous post links, by publication date. </li>
                <li>Support for image metadata like thumbnails, <a
                        href="https://ogp.me/">OpenGraph</a> images and <a
                        href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/abouts-cards">Twitter
                        cards</a> &mdash; this will be handy for migrating Neat Hobby!
                </li>
                <li>An RSS feed.</li>
                <li>Archives by date.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The first three are the most important, the bare "minimum viable product"
            </p>

            <p>Things I can live without:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Pagination.</li>
                <li>Archives by category or tag.</li>
                <li>Hosted, remote administration. I don't want to run any executables on
                    the server, I'll just FTP it old school.</li>
                <li>Comments (see note about executables above).</li>
                <li>Built-in search (just Google it).</li>
                <li>Trackback, site pings, notifications, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is gonna be basic computer stuff: file management, text parsing,
                simple graphing challenges, building indexes. I'm not inventing
                <em>anything</em> new at all &mdash; and yet, I'm excited? I just wanna
                build something, and that's a helluva lot more interesting than migrating
                this creaky old site to a new home.</p>
