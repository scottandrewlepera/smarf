    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

    <p>If you're reading this, hello! I have torn down this weblog, down
        to this single index page. There is no styling, no dynamic
        content, no scripts, no archives, no tags or categories. Just a
        fresh start,
        right here.</p>

    <p>I'm going to rebuild this blog as a static site. I mentioned last
        week that I have to change hosting providers and wasn't looking
        forward to moving this website. But I got to thinking about how
        a lot of what I've maintained here over the years isn't really
        useful anymore. I really don't want to wrangle with Wordpress or
        other blogging software. Most of the custom programming I've
        done has been to support defunct things like the Demo Club and
        email lists. So there no good reason to keep maintaining a
        database and PHP install.</p>

    <p>I've looked into all the hot new static site generators and while
        there's a ton of them, I'm not excited by any of them. Plus,
        there's always <em>something</em> that needs custom hacking, and
        the hacking part is fun. And it's been awhile since I've hacked
        something together just for myself.</p>

    <p>So I'm going to write my own static blog generator, and blog
        about it here. It's the perfect time for this. We're sliding
        into winter, and I need a project. I'm not writing any music.
        I'm 20 pages deep into a comic script that I have no energy to
        start drawing yet. So yeah, let's do this!</p>

    <h2>Eating an elephant</h2>

    <p>I'm making a promise to myself right now that I'm only going to
        work on one tiny feature at a time and go easy on myself. This
        is how I finished THE LAST REUNION SHOW, basically a panel or
        two every evening was enough to feel like I'd done something.
    </p>

    <p>I have some very basic requirements:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>File-based, so I can add a post by saving a file from a text
            editor.</li>
        <li>Markdown support, so I don't have to write out HTML for
            unordered lists like this one, grrr.</li>
        <li>A common metadata format, probably based on frontmatter.
        </li>
        <li>Next and previous post links, by publication date.</li>
        <li>Support for image metadata like thumbnails and OpenGraph
            images -- this will be handy for migrating Neat Hobby!</li>
        <li>An RSS or Atom feed.</li>
        <li>Archives by date.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The first three are the most important, the bare "minimum viable
        product"</p>

    <p>Things I can live without:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Pagination.</li>
        <li>Archives by category or tag.</li>
        <li>Hosted, remote administration. I don't want to run any
            executables on the server, I'll just FTP it old school.</li>
        <li>Comments (see note about executables above).</li>
        <li>Built-in search (just Google it).</li>
        <li>Trackback, site pings, notifications, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is gonna be basic computer stuff: file management, text
        parsing, simple graphing challenges, building indexes. I'm not
        inventing <em>anything</em> new at all &mdash; and yet, I'm
        excited? I just wanna build something, and that's a helluva 
        lot more interesting than migrating this creaky old site 
        to a new home.</p>
